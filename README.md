# freecad_commandline
Making the dream of many come true. Command line


### Installing this plugin is as simple as downloading the two files from this repo, placing them in your freecad macros folder, and running it.

In order for us to build something big with this, it would be ideal for those who want to contribute with translations of commands, creating new files with a structure similar to the one uploaded as an example in Spanish "commands.json", it is oriented to production in the BIM bank, therefore it focuses on these BIM tools, those who want can build more libraries of commands in json for other banks, and languages, we could upload them to folders in the repo that are ordered, by language, and then call them bim.commands.json, FEM.commands.json, part.commands.json... and so on so that everyone is used to always working with the same bank, only using the commands of their preference or can add the ones they are missing.
