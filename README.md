# freecad_commandline
Making the dream of many come true. Command line

### Installing this plugin is as simple as downloading the file .FCMacro from this repo, placing that in your freecad macros folder, and running it.


### To use it:
- Run the macro
- Press the Esc key: this will always focus the text box every time you want to write the name of the command globally, the only thing that intervenes when using freecad by default is that it does not deselect all the elements.
- Write the approximate name of the required command
- You can navigate with the up and down arrows until you find the desired one, then press enter. The command is executed
- If you want to reuse the commands used, without typing any suggestion you can press the down arrow, and the last 4 commands used will appear
